# libsql-d

Dlang bindings for [Libsql](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql), an Sqlite fork created by Turso, that supports remote connections to a server. 
Based on the C bindings (experimental).

To use it, you need first to build libsql from the sources with 

cargo xtask build

and set the LIBSQL_PATH environment variable, to the the location of libsql_experimental.a in your system (like in my set_env.sh script).

Then build it with 

  dub build 

## Testing

We use [Silly](https://code.dlang.org/packages/silly) for testing. You can run the tests using 

dub test

By default, the tests uses the in memory database, but you can use  a different 
one by setting the LIBSQL_URL environment variable. For instance, run

  turso dev 

and set 

  export LIBSQL_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
